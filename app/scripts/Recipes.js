If the soup is a little too sour for your taste, add 1 to 2 teaspoons sugar (to balance out the lime juice).',
      'To serve, place a generous mound of noodles in each bowl, then top with the hot soup. Finish with a final sprinkling of pepper and fresh cilantro. If desired, serve with Thai chili sauce to give your soup an extra kick of spicy flavor.',
