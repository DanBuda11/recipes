#Recipe App
I love to cook. A lot. And while I currently store all my recipes in Google Drive, they're pretty much all PDFs, so it can be a pain to read them on my phone. So this is basically a simple app to save all my favorite recipes that is responsive to any device and make it easier to read everything. And while yes, the name is absolutely horrid, at least it rhymes...
