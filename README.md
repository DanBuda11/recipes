#Recipe App

I love to cook. A lot. And while I currently store all my recipes in Google Drive, they're pretty much all PDFs, so it can be a pain to read them on my phone. So this is basically a simple app to save all my favorite recipes that is responsive to any device and make it easier to read everything.

Made with:
*React
*Sass
